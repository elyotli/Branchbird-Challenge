		<h1>Effect of Gentrification on Chicago Crimes</h1>
	</div>

	<div class='banner'>
		<p>A good friend of mine is looking to buy a house in Chicago. His real estate agent recommended to him west loop as an "up and coming" neighborhood to consider.</p>
		<p>Many Chicagoans are familiar with these "up and coming" neighborhoods, like west loop and uptown. These neighborhoods, especially uptown, are not known to be very safe. Naturally, the real estate agent assured him that these neighborhood has been undergoing a lot ofgentrification, and they are becoming much safer. </p>
		<p>According to the agent, we should expect a crime rate drop in these areas due to an increase in new construction, right?</p>

	<h3 class='title'>Number of crimes and new construction by year in West Loop</h3>
	<div class='graph1'>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>The number of crimes in west loop has been dropping since 2006, but number of new construction did not start pick up until 2011. New construction does not seem to be a primary factor in the drop in crime rate. </p>
		<p>Maybe west loop is an exception to our expectation. Let's take a look at entire Chicago.</p>
	</div>

	<h3 class='title'>Number of crimes and new construction by year in Chicago</h3>
	<div class='graph2'>
		
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>Overall Chicago crime rate has also decreased since 2006, and the number of new construction did not increase drastically like it did in west loop. Thus, the drop in crimes is a much larger Chicago trend than a local west loop trend.</p>

		<p>We do see a increase in overall Chicago crime rate in 2014, but this increase is not repeated in west loop. Could this be the effect of gentrification we are looking for? With only 1 year of data as proof, we cannot say for sure.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>So is the real estate agent wrong to say that these neighborhoods are gettin safer? We will need to take a deep look at the nature of these crimes. Maybe the more severe crimes has dropped while petty crimes like theft has increased.</p>

			<button type="button" class="button" id="westloop">West Loop</button>
			<button type="button" class="button" id="uptown">Uptown</button>
			<button type="button" class="button" id="chicago">Chicago</button>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>Comparing between west loop, uptown, and entire Chicago, west loop actually has the lowest rise in theft since 2011. The crime type distribution in west loop also has not drastically changed. Again, we do not have enough data to disprove a long term trend, but we certainly do not see a short term change.</p>

		<p>With the data at hand, I would recommend my friend to be cautious with the expection that these neighborhoods will get much safer in the near term.</p>

	<h3 class='title'>Challenges</h3>
	<div>
		<p> The data processing in this assignment really surprised me. Even though DevBootcamp trained me in web development, when it comes to analyzing data, I still very much think in Excel like a management consultant. Not being able to easily save the result of every query into spreadsheets was a big pain and cost me a lot of valuable time.</p>
		<p> D3 was also much harder than I expected. It's my 2nd time touching D3 (first time was a video tutorial), and I had to put in a lot of work to display the data. For these line graphs, it would have been much easier to work with a more concise tool like Google line charts.</p>
		<p> I really enjoyed this challenge. This was a great review to rails and I learned a lot about working with a greater amount of data. I wish I had more time to make this page prettier.</p>
